Release Process
---------------

This documents the steps to deliver working release versions of Spar.


=======================
Ready Files for Release
=======================

1) finalize changes to the git repository master branch
2) git checkout release
3) git merge master
4) clean up conflicts and commit the result
5) the release branch now has the release version of files


=======================
Generate a Release
==================

The bin/make-release.sh script will build a directory with all the files
needed for a public release of the Spar app and support files.  The
directory is under release and is named spar-CURRENTDATE.  This directory
can be archived and sent to IT for placement on the web server.
